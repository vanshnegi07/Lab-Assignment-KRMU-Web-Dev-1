# Portfolio Website – Lab Assignment 3

This is my portfolio website made for Web Development Lab Assignment 3. I have built it using only HTML and CSS. The main aim was to make a simple and responsive one-page website.

## About the Project
The website has basic sections like Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact and Footer. I have used Flexbox and CSS Grid where needed, and also added media queries so it works on mobile, tablet and desktop. I have also used my own photo in the hero section.

## What I Used
- HTML and CSS only  
- Flexbox for layout  
- CSS Grid for the skills and projects  
- Media queries for responsiveness  
- A few hover effects and small animations  

## How to View
Just open the **index.html** file in any browser.  
No JavaScript or extra setup is required.

## Notes
This project is part of my first semester work for BTech CSE (AI & ML).
