Portfolio Website – Lab Assignment 3

This is my portfolio website created for Web Development Lab Assignment 3.  
I have made the whole project using only HTML and CSS. The goal was to build
a simple one-page website that looks clean and also works on mobile, tablet
and desktop screens.

Sections included in the website:
- Header and Navigation
- Hero section with my photo
- About Me
- Skills (made using CSS Grid)
- Projects (also using Grid)
- Contact form (static)
- Footer

Technologies and concepts used:
- HTML and CSS
- Flexbox for layout
- CSS Grid for skills and projects
- Media queries for responsiveness
- Basic hover effects and small transitions
- Relative units like %, rem, vw and vh

How to view:
Open the file named index.html in any browser. No setup or JavaScript is required.

Note:
This project is part of my first semester work for BTech CSE (AI & ML).
